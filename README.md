# CourseBinarySearchTree

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  The problem that I was solving in this project was to use a data structure to sort through a CSV file holding data for courses and their prerequisites.
  This requires data input, data sorting through an algorithm and then managing that data to be useful for the data within the data structure. This  
  involved choosing between three different data structures, along with analyzing the pros and cons of each. This was aided by running a Big O runtime 
  analysis for each line of code to see which structure would be the fastest and more efficient choice.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  I approached the problem by first analyzing the runtimes for the project though each data structure for each line of code that the
  data structure would need in order to manage the course data. The three data structures were a vector, a hash table, and a binary search tree.
  I then used that data to then choose the data structure that would manage the data, which was a BST. It is important to understand different data structures
  because it gives a developer to have knowledge of multiple ways to problem solve and to be able to apply them to their programming. If a developer knows how
  to handle different programming problems by understanding the best use cases for each data structure, they will be able to handle and solve algorythmic problems
  with the best case scenario. It is always good to be a "swiss army knife" in your profession!

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  ANy roadblocks I encountered were overcome by persistance and research. For reasearch purposes, I used our course book about data structures and algorithms using our
  'zybooks' book, resources given by our instuctor, announcements given by our instructor, and utilizing overstack.com.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by learning how to properly brainstorm and design programs. I was able to
  achieve this through developing pseudocode to develop the logic aspect of the program and to map out how the code will function within the program. I also learned how to
  effectively develop a binary search tree!

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  My work on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by continuing to sharpen my OOP skills. In this project, I was able
  to continue to have my code be maintanable through detailed comments, readable by utilizing proper whitespace, and adaptable by creating and utilizing an algorithm to have the
  ability to manage data with simplicity with its users!
